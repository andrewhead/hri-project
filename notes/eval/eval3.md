# Evaluation 3: Interviews with Experienced Laser Cutters

## Overview

### Purpose

To understand the difficulty of working with the laser cutter.

### Summary

## Procedure

I record audio for each of the questions so that I can refer back to it later.
The participant is told that the study will take about 30 minutes of their time.

In some conditions, I ask the participant to reproduce a workpiece that I provide.
I see how many iterations it takes for them to get the parameters correct.
I ask them to place the drawing at different positions each time.

### Questions

1. Can you describe some of the artifacts that you've designed with the laser cutter?
2. What is the angriest you have been with the laser cutter?  What caused this anger?
3. How many iterations did it take to get the design right?
4. Can you describe for me in your own words what each of the following parameters change on the laser cutter?
    * Power
    * Speed
    * PPI
