# Explanation of purpose

Here are some examples of what you can cut with a laser cutter
**Show: vector cut (CITRIS tag), engraving, raster (ribbon)**
There are a couple of different ways to set parameters.
Today you're going to try out a couple of them.
**Show a printout of a couple of two interfaces.**

# Safety Priorities

Since this is a laser, it can set stuff on fire.
Let me know if you see a fire, and if so, we'll pause the cut.
Do not stare into the laser!
Look at it only indirectly.

# How you will participate

I'm going to ask you to try out a couple of different interfaces for determining laser cutter parameters.
I'll show you an engraving you have to reproduce.
You want the result to be just the right settings: not too dark or too light.
Once you've found the best possible arrangement, you'll tell me 'submit'

# Intro to interface 1

In this interface, each of these sliders refer to a parameter for the laser cutter.
I won't tell you any more than that.
By altering these parameters with these sliders, you can submit a laser cutter job.
Hit "submit" when you're ready to print it out.
I'll act in the role of propagating your requests to the machine.

Once it's printed out, we'll take it out and look at it.
Then you'll adjust the parameters.
We'll keep doing it until you've reached the right settings.

Let's give this a shot.
Change the parameters and then hit "submit" (though don't actually hit it).
The laser cutter will go "vroom, vroo".
We'll pull out the last piece that was cut out and examine it.
From this, you decide how to change the levers and submit the next one.

When you're satisfied with the reproduction, press "done!".

# Intro to interface 2

In this interface, you'll tell the laser cutter which cut best matches the cut that you want to get to.
The laser cutter will provide you with a group of examples.
Your job is to arrange them from the best reproduction to the worst.

When each of them comes out, I'll number them and give them to you.
The machine will ask you to arrange cuts that have a certain index.
Then you'll update the interface with the order that you've determined.
Then you'll hit submit.
The machine will produce more examples for you to submit.
When you've found one that you think is a perfect reproduction, hand it to me.

Let's give this a shot.
Sort these out here, then rearrange the numbers in the interface.
Pretend to hit the submit button here.
Then the machine will cut out extras.
We'll take them out and number them.
You arrange them.
Then update the machine with this numbering.
All right, are you ready?

# Possible pitfalls (experimental notes)

There is no practice here.
Of course, having practice would stand in the way of us understanding how people start to learn these interfaces.
