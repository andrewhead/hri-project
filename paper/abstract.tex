Every day, people work with machines with unfamiliar models of operation.
While a human knows their end goal, it can be difficult to express this in terms of the parameters the machine makes available.
This paper compares two algorithms---Bayesian Optimization and Nelder-Mead---to help humans achieve arbitrary goals with machines with unfamiliar models of operation.
Both algorithms take advantage of the fact that humans are good at comparing outcomes.
I implement interfaces for each algorithm for humans to guide it in achieving a goal.
In a 28-participant Mechanical Turk study, I report each algorithm's ability to achieve the user's goal.
I also report on people's perceptions of each algorithm:
In this study, I show that while a Bayesian Optimization algorithm seemed more random, participants felt that it better achieved the goal.
While Nelder-Mead appeared to get better over time to participants, it seemed more likely to get stuck.
