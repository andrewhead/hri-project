# Contribution

* Through preliminary tests, we show the application of response surface methodology form of active learning for non-experts or non-academics.  We collect observations of challenges of working with the noisy data of this group and recommendations of rating systems for the future.

# Cool things to discuss

* We may be able to find the nature of models that people produce.  As discussed in Box \amp; Draper (1987), are there ridges that show alternative near-optimal solutions?  And can this information feed back into choosing the right models right off the bat for other users?
* Consider how a machine could help a user with the WHICH, HOW, and WHY?
