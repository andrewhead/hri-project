\section{Conclusion}

People frequently have to work with machines to achieve some subjective goal with parameters they do not understand.
This paper compares two algorithms to help humans achieve such goals by systematically exploring parameter spaces.
While the Nelder-Mead optimization method appears less random to users than Bayesian optimization, the latter appears less likely to prematurely converge.
Future work should address three issues.
First, it should provide a systematic review of algorithms equipped to solve this problem and a comparison of human perceptions of these methods.
Second, it should explore a wider range of mechanisms for expressing rankings, beyond just pairs and sorted lists.
Third, it should do this in a domain-independent way, beyond just fabrication machines.
