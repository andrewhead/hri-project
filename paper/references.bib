In particular, non-technical users must be able to modify a robot's behaviour to enable it to perform new, previously unknown tasks. Learning from demonstration is a viable means to transfer a desired control policy onto a robot and mixed-initiative control provides a method for smooth transitioning between learning and acting. We present a learning system (dogged learning) that combines learning from demonstration and mixed initiative control to enable lifelong learning for unknown tasks. We have implemented dogged learning on a Sony Aibo and successfully taught it behaviours such as mimicry and ball seeking},

A number of recent works have explored interactive approaches to demonstration, in which both the robot and the teacher are able to select training examples. In this paper, we focus on a demonstration selection algorithm used by the robot to identify informative states for demonstration. Existing automated approaches for demonstration selection typically rely on a single threshold value, which is applied to a measure of action confidence. We highlight the limitations of using a single fixed threshold for a specific subset of algorithms, and contribute a method for automatically setting multiple confidence thresholds designed to target domain states with the greatest uncertainty. We present a comparison of our multi-threshold selection method to confidence-based selection using a single fixed threshold, and to manual data selection by a human teacher. Our results indicate that the automated multi-threshold approach significantly reduces the number of demonstrations required to learn the task.},

LaserOrigami is substantially faster than traditional 3D fabrication techniques such as 3D printing and unlike traditional laser cutting the resulting 3D objects require no manual assembly. The key idea behind LaserOrigami is that it achieves three-dimensionality by folding and stretching the workpiece, rather than by placing joints, thereby eliminating the need for manual assembly. LaserOrigami achieves this by heating up selected regions of the workpiece until they become compliant and bend down under the force of gravity. LaserOrigami administers the heat by defocusing the laser, which distributes the laser's power across a larger surface. LaserOrigami implements cutting and bending in a single integrated process by automatically moving the cutting table up and down--when users take out the workpiece, it is already fully assembled. We present the three main design elements of LaserOrigami: the bend, the suspender, and the stretch, and demonstrate how to use them to fabricate a range of physical objects. Finally, we demonstrate an interactive fabrication version of LaserOrigami, a process in which user interaction and fabrication alternate step-by-step.},

Recent interactive fabrication tools reintroduce this directness, but at the expense of precision. In this paper, we introduce constructable, an interactive drafting table that produces precise physical output in every step. Users interact by drafting directly on the workpiece using a hand-held laser pointer. The system tracks the pointer, beautifies its path, and implements its effect by cutting the workpiece using a fast high-powered laser cutter. Constructable achieves precision through tool-specific constraints, user-defined sketch lines, and by using the laser cutter itself for all visual feedback, rather than using a screen or projection. We demonstrate how constructable allows creating simple but functional devices, including a simple gearbox, that cannot be created with traditional interactive fabrication tools.},

Relying on a pre-designed 3D model, the computer gets into action only when the milling bit risks the objects integrity, preventing damage by slowing down the spindle speed, while the rest of the time it allows complete gestural freedom. We present the technology and explore several interaction methodologies for carving. In addition, we present a user study that reveals how synergetic cooperation between human and machine preserves the expressiveness of manual practice. This quality of the hybrid territory evolves into design personalization.

	abstract = {Even though considered a rapid prototyping tool, 3D printing is so slow that a reasonably sized object requires printing overnight. This slows designers down to a single iteration per day. In this paper, we propose to instead print low-fidelity wireframe previews in the early stages of the design process. Wireframe previews are 3D prints in which surfaces have been replaced with a wireframe mesh. Since wireframe previews are to scale and represent the overall shape of the 3D object, they allow users to quickly verify key aspects of their 3D design, such as the ergonomic fit. To maximize the speed-up, we instruct 3D printers to extrude filament not layer-by-layer, but directly in 3D-space, allowing them to create the edges of the wireframe model directly one stroke at a time. This allows us to achieve speed-ups of up to a factor of 10 compared to traditional layer-based printing. We demonstrate how to achieve wireframe previews on standard FDM 3D printers, such as the PrintrBot or the Kossel mini. Users only need to install the WirePrint software, making our approach applicable to many 3D printers already in use today. Finally, wireframe previews use only a fraction of material required for a regular print, making it even more affordable to iterate.},

This enables the evolution strategy (ES) to adapt the correct scaling of a given problem and also ensures invariance with respect to any rotation of the fitness function (or the coordinate system). Especially rotation invariance, here resulting directly from the coordinate system independent adaptation of the mutation distribution, is an essential feature of the ES with regard to its general applicability to complex fitness functions. Compared to previous work on this subject, the introduced formulation facilitates an interpretation of the resulting mutation distribution, making sensible manipulation by the user possible (if desired). Furthermore it enables a more effective control of the overall mutation variance (expected step length)},

We present methods which can be used to analyse the raw data of a benchmark experiment and derive some insight regarding the answers to these questions. We employ the presented methods to analyse the BBOB’09 benchmark results and present some initial findings.},

	abstract = {Past research on shape displays has primarily focused on rendering content and user interface elements through shape output, with less emphasis on dynamically changing UIs. We propose utilizing shape displays in three different ways to mediate interaction: to facilitate by providing dynamic physical affordances through shape change, to restrict by guiding users with dynamic physical constraints, and to manipulate by actuating physical objects. We outline potential interaction techniques and introduce Dynamic Physical Affordances and Constraints with our inFORM system, built on top of a state-of-the-art shape display, which provides for variable stiffness rendering and real-time user input through direct touch and tangible interaction. A set of motivating examples demonstrates how dynamic affordances, constraints and object actuation can create novel interaction possibilities.},

	abstract = {3D printers enable designers and makers to rapidly produce physical models of future products. Today these physical prototypes are mostly passive. Our research goal is to enable users to turn models produced on commodity 3D printers into interactive objects with a minimum of required assembly or instrumentation. We present Sauron, an embedded machine vision-based system for sensing human input on physical controls like buttons, sliders, and joysticks. With Sauron, designers attach a single camera with integrated ring light to a printed prototype. This camera observes the interior portions of input components to determine their state. In many prototypes, input components may be occluded or outside the viewing frustum of a single camera. We introduce algorithms that generate internal geometry and calculate mirror placements to redirect input motion into the visible camera area. To investigate the space of designs that can be built with Sauron along with its limitations, we built prototype devices, evaluated the suitability of existing models for vision sensing, and performed an informal study with three CAD users. While our approach imposes some constraints on device design, results suggest that it is expressive and accessible enough to enable constructing a useful variety of devices.},
