\subsection{Future Work}

I worked to produce expression mechanisms for the algorithms that closely matched the input to each of the algorithm and would be rapid for users to produce.
However, it's not clear that these are the best expression mechanisms.

Furthermore, additional work would need to be done to understand how rankings and comparisons could be implemented physically for users working with a fabrication machine.

Scale this up to a larger input space.
