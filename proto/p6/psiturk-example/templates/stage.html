                <h4>Instructions</h4>

                <p>
                In this activity, you will guide a computer algorithm to find a target image.
                The computer will show you example images.
                Your will compare these examples.
                After you compare them, the computer will suggest new examples for comparison.
                </p>

                <p>
                Each new set of examples from the computer will get you closer to the target image, based on your comparisons.
                Your job is to give accurate comparison judgments so that the computer rapidly finds the right target image.
                </p>

                <h6>To rank the examples, do the following.</h6>

                <p>
                There will be a row of examples on the page.
                Drag the examples to order them from <b>best</b> to <b>worst</b>.
                </p>

                <p>
                When you're happy with the ordering, click <b>I Have Sorted the Images</b>.
                The algorithm will fetch more examples for you to compare.
                </p>

                <h6>To complete the HIT</h6>

                <p>
                The task will end when the algorithm has given you the target image, and you have selected it as the best one.
                <i>In some cases, after many comparisons, the algorithm may not reach the expected goal.</i>
                If the algorithm seems to "get stuck", click on the <b>"Images Aren't Getting Any Better"</b> button to end the task.
                This button appears after 10 comparisons to give the algorithm a chance to show enough examples.
                You will still get compensated for this HIT if you click this button.
